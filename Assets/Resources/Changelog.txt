## [0.1.18] - 2025-07-03
### Summary
Refactored card visualization logic. Expect to see fewer animation glitches and sorting errors.

### Fixes
- Separated the resting position of cards from their animating position. This should result in fewer glitches and conflicting animations.
- Separated card presentation and animation from orchestrating visuals. This should result in fewer glitches and conflicting animations, making it simpler to spot such issues in the future.
